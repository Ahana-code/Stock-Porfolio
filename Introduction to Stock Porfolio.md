What is a stock portfolio tracker?

A stock portfolio tracker is a tool that helps users keep track of the stocks they own. 

It shows things like:

Which stocks they have,
How many shares they own,
The price of those stocks,and 
Whether they are making a profit or a loss.

Built a visually appealing and user-friendly stock portfolio tracker that allows investors to monitor stocks from multiple international markets in real time. The tool is designed for simplicity while delivering key financial insights at a glance.
