What is a stock portfolio tracker?
A stock portfolio tracker is a tool that helps users keep track of the stocks they own. 
It shows things like:
Which stocks they have,
How many shares they own,
The price of those stocks,and 
Whether they are making a profit or a loss.

Built a visually appealing and user-friendly stock portfolio tracker that allows investors to monitor stocks from multiple international markets in real time. The tool is designed for simplicity while delivering key financial insights at a glance.

ðŸ”¹ Real-Time Stock Data â€“ Fetches live stock prices and percentage changes.
ðŸ”¹ Supports International Stocks â€“ Track equities from global exchanges.
ðŸ”¹ Secure Authentication â€“ Integrated Google login for a personalized experience.
ðŸ”¹ Modern UI â€“ A sleek interface with a royal blue & violet color scheme.

This project combines Python (Flask) and financial APIs to provide an efficient and intuitive stock tracking experience. Excited to keep improving and expanding its features! ðŸ’¡ðŸ“Š
